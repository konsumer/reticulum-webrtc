# You can configure the printing command.
# This will use the default CUPS printer on
# your system.

# You can specify what printer to use
# print_command = lp -d [PRINTER_NAME]

# Or specify more advanced options. This
# example works well for small thermal-
# roll printers:
# print_command = lp -d [PRINTER_NAME] -o cpi=16 -o lpi=8

# This one is more suitable for full-sheet
# printers. It will print a QR code at the center of any media
# your printer will accept, print in portrait mode, and move the message to
# the top of the print queue:
# print_command = lp -d [PRINTER_NAME] -o job-priority=100 -o media=Custom.75x75mm -o orientation-requested=3

# But you can modify the size to fit your needs.
# The custom media option accepts millimeters, centimeters, and
# inches in a width by length format like so:
# -o media=Custom.[WIDTH]x[LENGTH][mm,cm,in]
#
# The job priority option accepts 1-100, though you can remove it
# entirely if you aren't concerned with a print queue:
# -o job-priority=[1-100]
#
# Finally, the orientation option allows for 90 degree rotations beginning with 3, so:
# -o orientation-requested=4 (landscape, 90 degrees)
# -o orientation-requested=5 (reverse portrait, 180 degrees)
#
# Here is the full command with the recommended customizable variables:
# print_command = lp -d [PRINTER_NAME] -o job-priority=[N] -o media=[MEDIA_SIZE] -o orientation-requested=[N] -o sides=one-sided

# For example, here's a configuration for USB thermal printer that uses the POS-58 PPD driver
# with rolls 47.98x209.9mm in size:
# print_command = lp -d [PRINTER_NAME] -o job-priority=100 -o media=custom_47.98x209.9mm_47.98x209.9mm -o sides=one-sided
